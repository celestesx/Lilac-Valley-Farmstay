                    <h1>The Barn's History</h1>
                    <p>Lilac Valley Farm Stay has a rich history of farming and has been privately owned for over 80 years. It was originally a working sheep and cattle farm. Using original Jarrah timber accents and beams, sustainability was a priority while recycling original parts of the barn during the renovation process.
                    </p>
                    <p>The development and interior attended to by Marina Ye focuses on craftsmanship and artisanal production with custom-made furniture, cabinetry, and upholstery.Minimalism as the main focus, the entire barn is furnished with the finest finishes and comfortable luxuries to reflect the entire mood of the barn.</p>
